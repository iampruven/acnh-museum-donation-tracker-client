Name of app:
ACNH:Museum Donation Tracker

Link to website:
https://capstone-one-vp.now.sh/

Intended audience:
Users who play Nintendo Switch's Animal Crossing:New Horizons.

Problem:
There is no way to know what items a user has donated to the museum, but to go up to each item in the many rooms to see what and when the user has donated the item. There are at least over 80 items per category, which can make keeping track somewhat difficult.

Solution:
As a fan of planning/tracking, I was inspired to create this app to help me keep track of what I have donated instead of keeping track on paper or a spreadsheet.
