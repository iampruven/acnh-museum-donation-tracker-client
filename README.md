###Name of app:
#ACNH:Museum Donation Tracker

###Link to website:
https://capstone-one-vp.now.sh/

###Intended audience:
Users who play Nintendo Switch's Animal Crossing:New Horizons.

###Problem:
There is no way to know what items a user has donated to the museum, but to go up to each item in the many rooms to see what and when the user has donated the item.
###Solution:
As a fan of planning/tracking, I was inspired to create this app to help me keep track of what I have donated instead of keeping track on paper or a spreadsheet.
